Aircraft in World War II:

World War II saw a massive evolution in the use of aircraft. Planes were no longer used solely for reconnaissance — they became central to both offensive and defensive operations. The Battle of Britain (1940) was the first major air campaign, where fighter aircraft like the British Spitfire and German Messerschmitt clashed in the skies.

Fighter planes were designed for speed and agility. Bombers such as the B-17 Flying Fortress were used for strategic bombing missions. Air superiority became essential for success in ground operations.

Pilots relied on rudimentary avionics, including basic radio communication and mechanical gauges. While advanced navigation tools were limited, pilots used maps and radio beacons to coordinate missions.

Kamikaze attacks — in which Japanese pilots deliberately crashed aircraft into enemy targets — also highlighted the psychological and tactical use of aviation in warfare.

Overall, World War II pushed the limits of aircraft design, with innovations in jet propulsion, radar, and pressurized cabins that laid the foundation for post-war aviation advances.
